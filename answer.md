[あなたのコードがどのように動作するのか、簡潔に説明してください。]

Hello,
I couldn't successfully completing the project, for the first test, I send a string of the explication of the error but nothing work. Sorry for that.
To success the other test and especially for the high number of n, I start to get all the number in an array with the function getAllNumberOfTheApi.
With this system I don't need to ask many times the API for the same number. After that in the recursive function, I just get the number associate in the array.

The point the hardest for me was: to understand the test of the project. Specially for the question number one, and I still don't understand. Because the test waits a string and I send a string with the report of the error.
